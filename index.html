		<h1>Nicole Savitsky</h1>

		<p>My name is Nicole Savitsky, 
            I am a Junior at the University of Michigan studying Information Analysis through the School of Information, 
            which is a program that examines the intersection of people, information, and technology, while developing a blend of technical aptitude and creative problem solving skills. 
			I am pairing this with a minor in Business through the Ross School of Business.  </p>
		<p>
            I am passionate about assessing data and using my hard and soft skills to solve problems and deliver value to companies and their users.  
            In my work, I aspire to go above and beyond what is expected of me. During my internship last summer, I was tasked with parsing and cleaning up large datasets. 
            This was a tedious manual task, so I decided to research possible solutions to streamline the process. 
			I developed Excel macros using VBA that I shared with my team, which they still use today, saving many hours of work. 
			</p>
		<p>
            Iâ€™m also fluent in Russian, my parents are immigrants, hoping to become fluent in Italian (I know around a conversational amount) 
            and am also fluent in a few coding languages. In my free time, I like to exercise, and also to watch sports like Formula 1. 
             </p>
